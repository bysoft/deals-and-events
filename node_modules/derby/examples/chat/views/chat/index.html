<!--
  Derby templates are similar to Mustache, except that they are first
  parsed as HTML, and there are a few extensions to make them work directly
  with models. A single HTML template defines the HTML output, the event
  handlers that update the model after user interaction, and the event handlers
  that update the DOM when the model changes.

  As in Mustache, double and triple curly braces output a value literally.
  Derby templates add double and triple parentheses, which output a value
  and set up model <- -> view bindings for that object.

  Elements that end in colon define the names of views. Pre-defined views are
  capitalized by convention, but view names are case-insensitive. Pre-defined views
  are automatically included when the page is rendered.
-->

<!-- Views can be imported using relative paths -->
